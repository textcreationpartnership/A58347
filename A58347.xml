            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Call you out to a new Merchandize, many of you have been negotiating in moſt of the known Cities of the World: but did any of you yet Trade at <hi>Nineveh?</hi> Let this be your Empory, buy up her Commodities, and ſet up an Exchange of her Wares: others may call upon you to traffick elſewhere; I direct you to this City. Some of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Aſhes, Sack-cloth, men with new lips, feet and hands, would be more uſeful now, than all the precious Rarities the richeſt Marts can afford: <hi>Nineveh</hi> is the Place, the way is beaten: you ſhall never repent of the Journey, 'tis a renowned place: in whoſe Ruins, you may find Treaſure enough to redeem you out of the preſent hazards, and to prevent future Miſerys. Indeed, I lay your Sandals before you, yet be not diſcouraged, ye ſhall go but like Merchant-Adventurers; if ye be Induſtrious ye may drive a very advantagious Trade, and come home laiden with the Riches of the ſame; linger not, ſet forth ſpeedily, and make a quick return, and Millions ſhall bleſs you: quarrel not who ſhall go firſt, but walk peaceably, and God Almighty proſper you: Apply your ſelves to the right work, and fall to right down Chriſtianity; let him be the beſt Man which can be moſt Zealous in this Religious Service. 'Tis hard to build a City, and 'twill be as hard to preſerve it: When a City is grown crazy with Sin, they muſt be Maſter-Workmen that repair its decays, or keep it from a Down-fall: be ne'er ſo well prepared, your Task requires almoſt Angelical puri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:100984:3"/>and fervent Soul: the reſt I might ſend to <hi>C. M. Coriolanus,</hi> who in the greateſt neceſſity never tendred the well-fare of the Inferiors, but lookt only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own Greatneſs and his great Ones: and held the poorer Citizens to ſad ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, leſt being ſupplyed with what they wanted, they might be enabled to call him and the reſt to account for their Injurys. Having taken upon me a dolorous Service, to whom ſhould I apply my ſelf, but to the true Mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> yes, there are ſins in the City, and theſe ſins do threaten Judgments; All ye which do face the one and fear the other, let me intreat You to ſigh and ſacrifice with me, that the City being penitent, neither the Peril nor periſhing of the City may be dreaded. To obtain this Bleſſing, I confeſs, I have (as I can) ſanctify'd my ſelf with ſome ſolemn Reſolutions: I deſire you to enter into the ſame Vow with me, not to deſert the City with your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Devotion, till a diſcharge be brought out of Heaven, and the City ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a Condition to be ſpared. I hear a loud ſpeech, <hi>what is not this City able to do?</hi> I wiſh it may be able to examine amd to extricate her ſelf: I cannot but love your City for her Breaſt, that ſhe proved ſuch a kind Nurſe to them which had neither Milk nor Maintenance, when upon the Death of their Mother they were as expoſed Children. I thought once to have call'd in all the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation to joyn in this Work: I would have Invited the Reverend of the Clergy to have aſſiſted in this Religious ſervice, I would have drawn in all the Civil and Common Lawyers to plead in Heaven for this City. I would have ſummoned in all the Phyſicians to have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred a ſoveraign Potion to this City: I thought to have ſent down to all the Citys in this Kingdom to have repaired hither themſelves, or ſend faithful ſubſtitutes, their Converſion, to officiate for the City in her greateſt peril: for ſeeing this is the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> why ſhould not all the Daughters do their Duty to their Mother, and wait upon her with their Prayers, Tears, Humiliation and Mortification? yes, they here vending all their Commoditys, and buying their principall Wares, 'tis convenient ſhould bleſs her with their Repentance, which hath bleſſed them with Revenue. But becauſe the moſt proper Cure is that which is perſonal, (people being able to prepare their Antidote) therefore ye knowing both the Malady and the Medicine, what need I trouble others? when ye are able (if ye will) to do the work your ſelves, and to be your own Phyſicians. And now I have left you in your own Hands (ſetting Life and Death before you, Oh that I could ſpeak to the City in general, that as ALL <hi>Nineveh,</hi> ſo ALL your City would be unanimous to unite their Repentance to keep oft a Judgment. But I ſee ſuch a Complicated Diſeaſe of bad Opinions, and ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> others going on in an Inſenſibility of any thing, that it is either Sin or Danger, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſpair to find the generality apprehenſive either of Diſeaſe or Cure. I remember that <hi>Calcedon</hi> was called, <hi>the Town of the Blind,</hi> becauſe they would not ſuffer an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Work-man to build their Houſes: and ſo, ſuch a blind City ſhall I leave you, if I ſet on Work half ſighted Architects, who can neither ſee Errors, nor forſee Hazards. Therefore I do ſet-by all the Humorous and Vitious amongſt you, and apply my ſelf only to thoſe that are truly Religious, which have the moſt Conſcience to diſcover ſin, and the moſt Remorſe to reconcile an offended God. It is a ſingular Work, and there muſt be ſingular Agents in it. It is <hi>That great City,</hi> and it muſt be <hi>that Great or Good
<pb facs="tcp:100984:3"/>party</hi> which muſt invert the ſtate, and avert the Judgment of the City: <hi>Lord, who am I, that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring forth the Children of Iſrael out of Aegypt?</hi> Exod. 3.11. So, who am I, that I ſhould ſummon a whole City to Repentance, and bring ſuch vaſt numbers out of the bondage of their Corruption and Deſtruction; Yet God hath given the Motion, and he may by ſuch a Stammering Tongue make his Meſſage effectual, who knows but this Cake of Barly-Bread may overturn the <hi>Medianites</hi> Tent? That this Lump of dry Figs may heal the Soar? That this Clay and Spittle may open the Eyes of the Blind? Bring forth your Repentance? and what may not ſuch an <hi>Heſter</hi> appearing do to reverſe a Decree? God is not ſo offended with the City, but Repentance can end the diſtaſte. I ſet before you <hi>Nineveh,</hi> not half ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in being Potent, as being Penitent. <hi>Jonah</hi> doth denounce a Judgment, God doth pronounce a Pardon; the Prophet muſt not ſpare, and yet God doth ſpare. The Prophet hath Threatned them into Repentance, then God doth not Threaten but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, not adjudg and accurſe, but accept and acquit: Repentance doth renew the People and revoke the Sentence. The Prophet was very oppoſite to it, but God doth bring in very appoſite Reaſons to ſatisfy his Contradicting ſpirit. God doth plead for the City, and doth plead againſt his own Prophet. This is the <hi>Dilemma</hi> how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may ſtand and the City may ſtand: The Prophecy is obey'd, and therefore there could be no overthrow, there was Repentance and therefore there could be no Rejection and Revenge; this is the middle way, which God doth make uſe of to anſwer the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi> God will not approve of his Prophets, if they do not proclaim Judgment. Tho the Prophets muſt thunder, yet God doth keep the thunder-bolt in his own hand. A ſinful people muſt be warned, a penitent people muſt not be deſtroy'd. This is one of the Riddle's of God's Mercy, which <hi>Jonah</hi> not being able to unfold, God doth expound it: doth God ſhew <hi>Jonah</hi> how he could propheſy no leſs, and yet how he himſelf could ſpare no leſs? <hi>Shouldſt not thou thus cry? ſhould they not thus reform? ſhould I not thus ſpare?</hi> God had taught <hi>Jonah</hi> many things, and now he doth reveal to him the <hi>Aenigma</hi> of his merciful Juſtice, how Juſtice and Mercy may meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame ſubject without Violation to either: The Prophet was in great blindneſs concerning this ſecret, and the City had like to have paid dearly for his want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but God ſatisfy'd the Doubt and ſaved the City. Oh that we could ſee ſuch a Riddle in your City, and thus explained. <hi>Jonah</hi> [now] doth cry, but is God believed? the overthrow is proclaimed, but do Men fly from it? the City is warn'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To prevent a general Overthrow, ſhall we ever ſee a general Converſion? What will Men leave their Seats of Honour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to Sick-cloath, Aſhes, Faſting, mighty Crys, turning from their evil Ways, and from the Violence of their Hands? Oh that we could ſee ſuch a beautiful City to honour our Nation, and to bleſs it ſelf. But I fear this is but a City of Deſires, and that it is not harder to build up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to her firſt Glory, than to raiſe up ſuch a City amongſt us; every Stone in this City may ſooner be altered, and new-laid, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Mens Minds and Conſciences. I doubt whether penitent Duties were ever truely intended amongſt us, and I am very jealous whether ever or no we ſhall ſee them really expreſt. Men can rather ſhoot the Gulf; climb the Alpes, go a pilgrimage over the whole Earth, than repent: All the Difficulties which ye ever met with, are not like this Streight. I confeſs here doth appear to be much Religion in the City, but what Repentance is there? or if Repentance, is it that of <hi>Nineveh?</hi> No, here are Sins enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a City, but is there Repentance enough to have it ſpared?

1. Their <hi>Evil ways</hi> do ſeem to have a Miſt upon them, they have not Eyes clear enough to ſee them, or Hearts tender enough to lament them: though they have <hi>ſtrayed</hi> far enough from the preſcript Rule of Obedience, and never a precept warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lawleſs Paths, yet they tread on, and conſider it not, the <hi>Ignis Erraticus</hi> hath lead them aſide, and lay not to Heart over what Rocks and Precipices they do paſs: Oh that there ſhould be ſuch Declinations under the directing Ordinances; or ſuch Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints amongſt inſtructed <hi>Chriſtians! No man ſaith, what have I done?</hi> Many a Man ſaith, <hi>what may I not do?</hi> People look upon their Faces, but ſeldom on their Conſciences: This claſped BOOK hath not been opened to view every leaf, nor this deep Well ſearched to the bottom theſe many years. Oh! how much Hyprocriſy, Apoſtacy, Bribery, Flattery, Blood, Blaſphemy, Southſaying. Sacriledg have been paſt over without the leaſt check or fret. If any Sins come under their Diſcovery, they are the ſins of the Age, or the ſin which Malignity have doom'd ſins, but they have neither Eye, nor Tongues, nor Hearts, to ſpy out to ſpeak out, or reflect upon their proper ſins; though they be as bitter as Gall, as red as Scarlet, as venomous as the poiſon of Aſps, as black as Satan, coming forth with a Steem of the bottomleſs Pit; yet there is neither Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs nor Conſcientiouſneſs of them: they are their proper ſins, and as they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them Conception and Birth, ſo they beſtow Education and Maintenance: they may have a ſtreet-cry, or pulpit noiſe (ſometimes) but the ſound is gon ſo ſoon as received; they deny them, conceal them, extenuate them and juſtify them; yea ſome are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to deride them: <hi>Fools make a mock of Sin,</hi> though it be to dance before a Calf of their own making, to triumph over a captivated <hi>Sampſon,</hi> or to quaff in the Bowls of the Sanctuary, or to preſent <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Head in a platter, or to cry Hail to the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he is leading away to be crucified. Theſe, or the like, are the Expreſſions which they do make to their Sins, rather than look agaſt upon them, loath them, bleed under them. How many Sinners have ye yet ſeen, that though they have done things contrary to the Torch Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Sun-Light of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the Tenor of their own <hi>Oaths,</hi> and the Terror of a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them, that have yet bluſh'd, ſob'd, or rung a hand, or bended a knee for them? No, they have done them, and ſtand up in the defence of them; after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions they do beſtow upon them protection. Now if People will not diſcern their Sins, how will they ever diſclaim them? if they will not look upon their evil ways, how will they ever turn form their evil ways? what little likelihood, what ſmall hopes of Converſion and Reformation?</p>

Oh! when will the Whip depart out of this City? when will the wild Beaſt's teeth fall out of their heads? when will the Hammers leave beating? or the Mill-Stones leave grinding? when will Repentance ſo reduce this City to Equity, that there need neither Tribunal to rectify Injuries, or Pulpit to touch Conſcience for Extortion?

            <p>GOD and the Prophet are here in earneſt Diſpute: <hi>Jonah</hi> raging and God reaſoning; <hi>Jonah</hi> full of Paſſion and God full of Compaſſion; <hi>Boni viri Lachrimabiles,</hi> good Men ſhould be ready to melt at Judgments: <hi>Jonah</hi> was firſt unfaithful, and next impatient: Ah <hi>Jonah!</hi> what thy God gentle and thou cruel? <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Repentance in the time limitted, prevented its Deſtruction: God hath no Sword for the yielding, but the obſtinate.</p>
            <p>How many Prophets have not been ſo ſucceſsful in forty Years, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was in forty Days? God will not remain dumb in the caſe of his Saints, but he will be a conſulting and a conferring God, both give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and have reaſon for them: he will plead with <hi>Cain</hi> for <hi>Abel</hi>'s Blood; with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> for taking away <hi>Sarah</hi> from <hi>Abraham;</hi> with <hi>Ahab</hi> for wreſting away <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard.</p>
            <p>As the Faithful have the Arrows of Gods Deliverance. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 13.17. So they have the Argument of his Juſtification. When a Soldier deſired <hi>Aug.

At which <hi>Auguſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100984:9"/>opened the Soldiers Caſe, and freed him. God will not leave his People to Subſtitutes, but will be heard himſelf.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This ſhews the Saints Caſe is never deſperate, God is their Pleader; what can all the Politicians and Crafts-Maſters, of the Word do againſt them? wicked men periſh by their own Inventions, how many men lye buried in the Aſhes of their own miſchievous Contrivements? Yee Righteous, though yee be even made a Spectacle to the World, Angels and Men, and accounted a People which have loſt their Graces and their Wits, matter it not, ſo long as you have Gods Confutation: How is the Miniſtry the Scoff the Age being neither fit to ſtand in the Gap, nor to ſtand above Ground; not to break Bread, nor to eat Bread; not to be Eyes to the People, nor to enjoy the Eyes in their Heads; let us order them out of their Livings, drive them by Droves out of their Cures, lock up all their Pulpit-Doors againſt them? Let us be quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Clamours, let us not fear to wander when God is our Guide:</p>
            <p n="2">2. But doth God plead, ſo we ſhould plead; happy is he which doth min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Tears with Mourners, which doth ſearch out the Periſhing in Priſon, which is the Shield of the Diſtreſſed, nay, the Orator of the Afflicted.</p>
            <p>Many Heathens have paſſionately ſought the preſervation of Juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet We rather ſupplant than ſupport, deſtroy than defend them, plot than plead. Are there not thoſe that inſtead of building a Tower, they will dig a Pit for their Friend; inſtead of ſtudying out terms for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, they lay in wait as they that ſet Snares. O where is the Juſt Mans Guardian? Where is the good Angel that doth attend upon the Diſtreſſed? no, Miſery hath no Champion, Innocency no Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ill do ſuch deſerve a Protecting God, or a Juſtifying Redeemer? Who ſhall ſweeten your Sorrows, or plead for you at Gods Throne?</p>
            <p>This ſhews that the diſtemper of Sin is not eaſily cured, nor the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Error remedied eaſily: <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s ſtrength can ſcarce break theſe Cords; O therefore beware how thou doſt open thy Doors to Sin, they muſt be pregnant Arguments which muſt Confute an habituated ſinner.</p>
            <p>Some poſſibly will ſay, how ſhall we be Penitents? that is, anſwer <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi>'s Penitential Work? would you know this? view the Original, and you ſhall find them penned down in the Catalogue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hearing God in his Meſſengers;</hi> for <hi>Nineveh</hi> is Converted by <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Preaching: People uſually find the way out of the World by the light of the Miniſtry, by the beat of that Drum they repair to Gods Muſter:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100984:9"/>
               <hi>Faith comes by Hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. as if the Ear were the Clicker-Gate of Salvation. <hi>Preaching is the power of God to Salvation.</hi> Rom. 1.16. and <hi>the ſavour of Life unto Life.</hi> 1. Cor. 2.16. Thou maieſt Eternally ſtarve in thy Tent, if thou doſt not go forth to gather this <hi>Manna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to be too curious in our Counſels. Nineveh</hi> doth accept of <hi>Jonah</hi> for a Prophet, though by Nation a Stranger, and a man oppoſite in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Enduring ſharp Doctrines. Jonah</hi> come not Flattering, but with a mouth full of Menaces: <hi>Yet forty days,</hi> &amp;c. He that cannot hear of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, will hardly hear of Reformation; it muſt be much knocking to break a Heart of Adamant: St. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt lay Blaſphemy and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the charge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> before they will be pricked to the Heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They Apprehend Danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the people of</hi> Nineveh <hi>believed God:</hi> when the Heavens write out our Judgments in Capital Letters, ſhall we not read our own condition? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Not delaying Repentance. Nineveh</hi> was a City of three days Journy, and <hi>Jonah</hi> had but, as it were, juſt entred the City, and what a new Face is there inſtantly to be diſcerned? <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Crys are heard, and the City is Converted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Sin hath its ſtirring motions.</hi> At <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Sermon, there was not only the ſhaking of Ears, but ſhaking of Limbs, the Cry will not ſuffer them to receive the Meſſage upon their ſeats, but they are forced to ſtand up to it; 'Tis not enough to ſee God angry, and not to pacify his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; No, this is but to take notice of the ſadneſs of the times, or to receive the bruit of impending Miſery; we are to do ſomething to avert the Puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Greatneſs is not thought on;</hi> This Cry doth not only make the Ears of the vulgar to tingle, but the Conſternation is entred the Palace; he that ſate on the Throne and did wear the Robe, is made to forget both his Throne and Robe, he not only moves with the reſt; but riſeth with the firſt; for, <hi>Word came to the King of</hi> Nineveh, <hi>and he aroſe from his Throne, and laid aſide his Robe.</hi> The mightieſt ſhould have their Judgment frays and ſhiver under Gods threatned Plagues; Is there any Antidote againſt <hi>Caeſar?</hi> Any preſervative againſt Divine Wrath? No, Gods Lightning ſtrikes upon the higheſt Mountains: What is a Throne to him that hath built his Stories in the Heavens? What is a Throne to him that is clothed with Jealouſy as with a Garment? Can a Golden Scepter fright away Judgments, or all the Jewels of the Crown, redeem
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100984:10"/>a man from Vengeance? No, God takes King by the Collar, and hurls them under his Feet.—That great <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that asked, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould hear his Voice?</hi> ſhall hear 'ere long, who is <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> — Oh, that many were not encloſed in their own Fat, and infatuated with their Chariots of Glory, as if they would out-run and out-ride all Miſery; like <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they have great Riches to truſt to, they diſtruſt not to be happy againſt Accidents; thoſe fat Bulls of <hi>Baſan</hi> which graze in green Paſtures, never look that they ſhall be taken by the Horns and Flayed; thoſe Leviathans which ſwim in the Ocean of Greatneſs, never expect that the Harping Iron ſhall be darted into their ſides, that they ſhall be played with like a Bird, — Theſe never riſe, forſake the Throne and caſt away the Robe; its a hard thing to ſee theſe Chuffs tremble, or to let fall an Eye-lid, or to bruiſe the Breaſt before a mortifying Preacher: <hi>Paſhur,</hi> that is a Governor never thinketh he ſhall be a Slave, and that his Name ſhall be <hi>Mager Miſſabib,</hi> fear round about. There lieth hid a kind of Sorcery in the Throne, the Robe is a kind of Enchanted Veſture; how many might have ſat in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, were it not for this Throne; and might have been arrayed in fine Linnen, which is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints, had it not been for this Robe! Do we not ſee that great Men contemn all Doctrine, and ſcorn Devour Meſſengers; if an <hi>Eliab</hi> doth reprove ſuch, he is made to fly the Country; if a <hi>Jeremiah</hi> deliver his Errand freely, 'tis enough to have his Prophecy cut in pieces with a Pen-Knife. If <hi>Cyril</hi> meddle with the great <hi>Juliar,</hi> he ſhall be hewn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and his Liver eaten up by the Heathens, <hi>p.</hi> 79. If <hi>Ignatius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Bardas</hi> for his vitious life, he ſhall be lock'd up in a Sepulcher for many years, afterwards baniſhed, and at laſt ſlain. The high-breſt Worldlings cannot endure a Check; the Throne and the Robe make men conceive themſelves ſuperiour to all Reproof, how do they ſnuff and ſnarl, fume and rage, ſhew their Tusks and put out their Stings, look like Leopards, and ſparkle like Baſilisks, if they be rebuked or threatned? A <hi>Jonah</hi>'s cry fills all the Country with Tumults, they ſtorm upon their Throne, and Vow by their Honours they will be revenged; one had better anger all the Witches and Conjurers, provoke all the Centaurs and Minotaurs in the World, than menace this haughty ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Generation; the Devil has his ſtrongeſt Chains upon the rich mens Heels; he is moſt Prince where diſdainful men ſit on the Throne, or wear the Robe. Have Rich men no Souls to ſave? or will Riches ſecure
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100984:10"/>them againſt Divine Vengeance, cannot God caſt down thy Throne? and tear in pieces thy Robe? ſmite thee upon the Throne? and ſtrip thee naked for all thy Robe? is a Golden Night-Cap a Head-piece? or a Velvet Jacket a Breaſt-Plate againſt his Judgments? why then doth not Greatneſs ſtoop as well as Poverty? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>An Humble Dreſs:</hi> for the King doth cover himſelf with Sack-cloth; What ſhall a King put on Sack-cloth? and ſhall we put on Silks and Sattins, Cloth of Silver and Gold? What be as Sumptuous as Lords, as Gorgeous as Princes? and yet is this dread of Judgments? diſmayed Repentance? oh feat Converts, oh ſpruce Penitents? where there is humiliation for Sin, there muſt be a mournful habit: elſe 'twill be ſaid, Thy ſpirit is not very ſad, thy dreſs is ſo trim; looſe attire ſhews a diſſolute mind; Penitents are not buſy in Haberdaſhers, Mercers, Feather-makers or Perfumers ſhops: No, <hi>Micah</hi> doth appear ſtript and naked, 1.8. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth go bare-foot, 20.2. the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> do not put on their Ornaments nor beſt Garments, Pouder, Wigs, Spangles, Cuts, Jags, Frizles, Criſpings, Purple and Crimſon are fitter for Swart-rutters and Ruffians, than for true Penitents. If there were no other Provocations in the Land, yet there were fuel enough for conſuming Judgment in peoples exceſſive and unlimited Pride; our patch't faces are enough to make us Monſters in Gods eyes, our long Tails to ſweep all Bleſſings out of the Nations: if one ſhould ſearch the Wardrobes, Cabinets, Complexion-Bottles, a man would wonder that the flying Book of Curſes had not already lighted upon this exotick Iſland, or that this Theater of Vanity were not burnt down with Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven; [What would this good man have ſaid if he had lived in this Debauched Generation, this Age of Whoring, Swearing, Curſing, Perjury, an Age wherein God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> God-likeneſs is perfectly hated; and thoſe moſt like the Devil only in eſteem and repute] <hi>See the Poſtſcript.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>An High Abaſement;</hi> the King doth not leave his Throne to take up an inferiour Chair, but he ſate upon Aſhes. O therefore upon the day of thy Repentance, let high Birth, high Creſts, high Looks, high Titles, all elate, inflate, lofty, ſtately, imaginating, ingrandiſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencies and priviledges be forgotten, and count thy ſelf the Bran of the Bolter, the ſweeping of the Floor, a ſcuttle, a ſpan-full of Aſhes; you ſee how the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> by this loud cry of <hi>Jonah</hi> makes Aſhes his Penitential Stool.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>A reſtraint of Delicacies.</hi> A Faſt is proclaimed and kept; when

This muſt not be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Repetition of Error in general, but every Treſpaſs which doth come to our Knowledg muſt be rehearſed upon our Tongues end; oh, therefore unravel your Lives, ſweep the hid corners, rake the Canels, lay open the ſecrets of your Heart and Lives, disburthen your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, let the feſtered Corruption run out at the mouth of the Wound, ſpeak out the Errors, and tell all the Crimes in Gods Ear.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>Reparation for Sin.</hi> The <hi>Ninevites</hi> had offended God many ways, and now they bring the oppoſite Vertues, they return back to God what is his own as well as they can, and clear the Arrearages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Devout Supplication; they cryed mightily unto God.</hi> The Penitent muſt not only be ſollicitous, but a Solicitor. How many have Filed off the Fetters of their Sins, eſcaped out of the Keepers hands, ſhut up the mouth of Hell, and ſtood ſpotleſs among the pure Angels by the benefit of Prayer; <hi>Moſes</hi> by lifting up his hand ſtruck down the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites; Hezekiah</hi> by crying to him that lived between the Cherubims, fetcht an Angel from Heaven, to deſtroy a Hundred Four Score and Five Thouſand in a Night; <hi>Aſa,</hi> but by ſaying, Help O Lord, we reſt on thee, and are come out againſt this Multitude, diſperſed an Army of Ten Hundred Thouſand; [and I am confident as great things may be done in this Age, by Prayer, for the people of God, as hath been done in any ſince the Creation;] a Chriſtian is never higher than when creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100984:11"/>upon his Knees, not ſtronger than, when he is ſtretching out his hands towards Heaven, by looking upwards than others can do by Plotting beneath. The People of God count Prayer their chief Engine, the effectual fervent Prayer of the Righteous availeth much, <hi>Nineveh</hi> cryed mightily.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Renovation of Life.</hi> Repentance without Reformation is a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Almighty God, is like running into the Peſt-Houſe where we firſt got our Plague-ſore. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth caſt off his old Companions when he began to Reign; <hi>Iſaeus,</hi> when a rare Lady was ſhewed him, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether ſhe was not fair, and fit for his Dalliance, he anſwered, I know not, for I have given over to be guided by my Eyes: What doſt thou Repent, and keep thy Whore in thy Houſe? What, wilt dy in her Arms, and yet be counted a Penitent, a Godly Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>A Reformation of Oppreſſion. Nineveh</hi> had been a Cruel, Bloody Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and remembred how many there were that could accuſe them of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Tyranny, that is a formal Repentance, where men are ſenſible of their damnifying injurious Courſes: Oppreſſion is of a Scarlet Hue, 'tis put among crying Sins; ſhall God remove Judgments when men are removing Land-marks? Shall God caſt away his Rod, when men are chaſtiſing with Scorpions? He muſt not expect to taſte of free Mercy that eats others Fruits without Money; 'Tis in vain for any to Sigh for Compaſſion, when the poor Cry for Vengeance, which ſwallow up Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Grave, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.12. which Groundſel their Eſtates with Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Roof them with Detriments, Plaſter them with the Brains of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Hang them with the Skins of Orphans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that is the Pleader for the Poor, will not be the Patron of Oppreſſors; till they have cured their Blood-ſhorten Eyes, let them not look up to Heaven for Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi> 1. This doth ſhew that Mercy is the Priviledg of the Penitent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where there is great Provocation, there may come a Pacification.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth ſhew that Pacification is to be reſolved on, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Profeſſion, but Repentance.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Nineveh doth apprehend danger;</hi> for they believed God, they verily thought the ſtate of their City was near Deſtruction, at the brink of Ruine; but we defy ſuch Seditious Preachers, Tumultuous Prophets; Calamity is but their Jealouſy, Peril but their Peeviſhneſs. We are a Righteous people and not to be puniſhed, a formidable people, and not to be frighted; they are a ſcandalous and audacious people which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify us with Judgments; we have Spears enough (as the <hi>French</hi> King ſaid, having 200000 Soldiers at his Heels,) to uphold the Heavens if they ſhould fall; This is the Confidence and Fool-hardineſs of this Age, though the Clouds gather yet we think of no Storm; though the Ship leaks we think of no Wreck; though the Houſe be on Fire, yet they ſtir not, our Ditch is the Sea, none can ſwim over to us, all our Ports are lock't [<hi>But Treachery can fill us with a foreign Enemy, and lay open our Ports to them,</hi> &amp;c.] none can force an entrance; Dangers are but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Apprehenſions of Male-Contents, or Dreams of Lunatick Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Nineveh</hi> doth not think of Greatneſs, for the King is firſt in the action; but alas, our Great ones are ſuch good Leaders, they muſt have the Path beaten: Greatneſs, which ſhould be exemplary, thinks it ſelf exempted; thoſe which ſhould be in the Front come in the Reer; 'tis a rare thing for an <hi>Obadiah</hi> to be one of Gods Nobles, or for a <hi>Daniel</hi> to open a Window towards <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> The Lions Whelps are a long time before they come to their Feet, they do not ſtir under a Month, nor walk under ſeven: The Devils Priſon is fill'd with Perſons of high Birth and Fortunes, he hath honorable Slaves, they go in Scarlet, wear Gold Chains, ride in Coaches, <hi>Whore Swear, Ram and Damn and Drink Health's at norate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="16">16. <hi>They had devout Supplication;</hi> they cry mightily; we muſt not look for mighty Comforts without mighty Cryes. God ſits on his Throne, but none make Addreſſes to him.</p>

5.

Indeed if a City doth live out of Fear, live in pleaſure, dwell careleſly, if the Harp, Viol, Tabret, Pipe, and, the VVine, be in their Feaſts; if they deride and defy Judgments, then God may fray the City in the midſt of her Jollity, Caſe up her Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bring in the Voyder to her ſumptuous Banquets; turn this Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing City into a ſorrowful Lady; yea, make this Melodious City a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> wherein there ſhall be nothing but Mourning and VVeeeping, and great Lamentation; inſtead of the Mirth of the City, and its Jollity, the cry of City ſhall go up to Heaven. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.12. If a City wax proud, inſolent, and daring, it ſhall know, neither Gates, Bars, VValls, Towers, impregnable Caſtles, or Millions of Armed Men, can or ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her; Gods confounding Judgment ſhall pull down the moſt potent and haughty City.

                  <p>This ſhews that God is the Citys Friend; yea, the City hath not ſuch a Patron as this Preſerver of Men. <hi>Except the Lord doth keep the City the Watch-man waketh hut in Vain.</hi> Pſal. 127.1.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Truſt not in your Marſhals or Magiſtrates, theſe are but your <hi>Dij Medioxumi,</hi> middle Gods; ye have the Lord God Almighty to rely upon; what need the City fear any thing if God be their Friend? tho' Friendſhip ſomtimes is dangerous, Men care not how they ſell their Friends like Commodities they have no uſe of, or make ſpoils of them, as ſpend-thrifts do of Eſtates: the perfidiouſneſs of Friends is ſuch, that it is a ſnare to be familiar: But God will give his own Weapons to the City to fight with, as <hi>Hercules</hi> gave his Bow and Arrows to <hi>Philoctetes</hi> his dear Friend. God will go through all extremitys with his City, 'tis no eaſy matter to perſwade a City out of Gods Favour; he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew her the Accuſations brought againſt her to teſtify the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100984:15"/>of his Love then make her away upon Suggeſtions and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It muſt be a high thing that can diſ-unite God and his City; God will ſearch ſtrictly before he will ſeparate. He doth ſo love a City that he would not ruin <hi>Sodom</hi> before he had examined it; ten Righteous might have at laſt preſerved it, it was burnt to Cinders for want of Saints, and not for want of a Compaſſionate God. God ſo loves a City, that he gives Laws for its ſafety, Deut. 20.10. <hi>When thou comeſt nigh to a City to fight againſt it, then proclaim Peace unto it: Wo be to him that doth make a breach,</hi> or ſhake a Stone in the VValls, or ſhed a drop of Blood, or rifle an innocent Tradeſ-man, till Conditions of Peace be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that if God be your Friend and reſtleſs grievances han't provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him to be your Adverſary, you may Trade freely, reſt quietly, fear no moleſtation neither at the Cuſtom-Houſe or Council Chamber. Zac. 8.4.5. <hi>There ſhall be old Men and old Women in the Streets, and every man walk with his ſtaff in his hand for very Age, the ſtreets of the City ſhall be full of Boys and Girls playing in it.</hi> God will lead them out of Doors in the day-time, and put them to bed at night, keep the Keys of the City and ſet Guards over them; ſerve God and he will not only give you a Charter, but be the City Standard-bearer and Champion. Whoſoever will not ſpare, HE will ſpare, becauſe it is a City, ſhould I not ſpare <hi>Nineveh</hi> a City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſhews that a City in it ſelf is a place of Honor; do men caſt contempt on that which God himſelf doth magnify, will God ſpare <hi>Nineveh</hi> becauſe a City, and ſhall not a City be thought worthy of an excellency; elſe we correct Gods Heraldry, and ſtrive who ſhall be the beſt Judges about Titles of Honour, let none deprive the City of its Cap of Maintenance, or abuſe the Furr'd Gown, <hi>for a City is the moſt principal thing of all things which can be constituted by Mans Reaſon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas:</hi> 'tis an ignoble ſpirit to vilify that which God and Nature has dignify'd.

                  <p n="2">II.

                  <p n="3">III. A City is a place of Honour, becauſe there is a dayly Mart, where by Exportation and Importation it doth ſupply other Countreys, and ſtore it ſelf with all manner of Neceſſaries.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. A City is a place of Honour, becauſe of Buildings; Houſes and Riches are given of the Lord. Art can preſent the Eye with no more pleaſing object than the ſight of a City.

                  <p n="8">8. A City is a place of Honour, in reſpect of large Payments; now in defraying Tributes and Cuſtoms, who exceeds the Citizens?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. This ſhews, That as a City is chief, ſo <hi>it ſhould be chief in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Demeanour.</hi> A City ſhould be a place of Example, the great <hi>Idea</hi> from which all round about ſhould be effigiated, the Prototype by which all adjacent places ſhould be ſtamped: Doth not a Citys Virtues diffuſe vertue: when it was asked why <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> was ſo good?

Yes, the City doth ſell her Examples, as well as her Commodities, and her Sins as well as her Wares; yea, the quick Trade doth run in Crimes, and ſhe ſends down them by whole-ſale into the Country: this Plague in the City infeſts the whole Nation: a whole Land may curſe a City for bad Preſidents: If the City be full of perverſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.9. the Diſobedience will ſpread to all parts. If the City be bloody, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 3.1. its enough to ſell Chopping-Knives to their Cuſtomers elſewhere. What pure Worſhip will be left in the Land, if the chief Citys of the ten Tribes ſet up Golden Calves, the whole Religion will ſeem to be nothing but a Bleating Crib to the Honour of theſe new Deitys; people far and near will Swear by the ſin of <hi>Samaria.</hi> The Luſt of <hi>Corinth</hi> made all <hi>Greece</hi> a Brothel-Houſe: the Intemperance of <hi>Plintine</hi> turn'd <hi>Egypt</hi> in a tipling

                  <p>This in general, but particularly, As God hath made you a City, ſo do you principle out Goodneſs to the Land: what a ſhame is it for the ſowreſt Fruit to grow upon the top Branches, the worſt Scholars to be in the upper Form? what ſhall the Men in Ruſſet teach Thee in thy Furs? the Leathern Girdle, the Gold Chain? the Swain, the Citizen? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Citizen ſhould ſhew his Cuſtomers the beſt Patterns of holy Life, and open the Pack of Religious Preſidents: a City ſhould be the Burſe of Virtuous Demeanours: Oh therefore hath God given you Honor, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, let the Wheel of Virtue ſtir here, and the Morning Star of Grace ſhine here: let not the miery way be cleaner than your Paved-ſtreets, and the Thatched ſhuds be neater then your Tiled Houſes: Let not the Country-Man when he comes among you be loathed with your Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or recoil at the Sight of your Fraud, or bluſh at you Neutrality, or deride your Pride, hiſs at your Malice, frieze at your Indevotion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A City ſhould ſerve God before others, becauſe God would ſpare a City before others, ſhould I not ſpare <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. This ſhews that if God will ſpare a City, becauſe a City, that the City ſhould ſpare it ſelf; nor ſuffer her immunitys to be infringed, when ſhe can preſerve them, nor her Rights to be be injured, when ſhe can vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them.

No marvel if God doth ſo plead for the preſervation of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> for it was no vulgar City, but a Great City: Yes, the greatneſs of it was a great inducement to God to reſtrain the imminent Danger of it: 1. Becauſe it had been long in coming to that greatneſs; Men riſe by degrees, and ſo do all other things: As an Elephant (as ſome ſay) is two years in bringing forth; an Oak is a hundred years in grouth, the durable Marble lyeth many thouſand years before it be hardned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Becauſe of its long ſtanding, it had continued in that flouriſhing Condition for above a thouſand years.

Sin Damns every thing to us, Grace makes every thing a Bleſſing, make good thy Tenure therefore, and fear not thy Free-hold. A Saint may enjoy a great Manſion, a great Caſtle, a great City.

'Tis ſaid of <hi>Alexius Comnenus,</hi> that when, upon day of his Inauguration, he ſubſcribed the Creed in a ſlow trembling manner, it was an ominous ſign to all, what a wicked Man he would prove, and how the ruin of the Empire was at hand. <hi>Philip</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> before the great Battle with <hi>Flaminius,</hi> ſtept up upon a Sepulchre to make an Oration to his Soldiers, it foretold the bad Event of the Fight; ſo we who have trod upon ſo many dead Heads of famous Martys, which at firſt conveyed to us our Faith and Worſhip: 'tis a kind of Prediction, that this at laſt will befal our Church. Is this the way to preſerve Bleſſings? No, oh why ſhall we compel happineſs to ſwim over Sea, and carry ſo many Bleſſings a-long with it, as we would be glad with wringing hands to recal: Oh, I ſpeak in a timely hour, your Sins I hope have not made God to abhor the excellency of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100984:29"/>he was immortal; If they were bright, he was ſhining; <hi>Crowned with Glory and Honor;</hi> if they had Heaven, he Paradiſe; if they had Revelations, be Myſterys: if they had Joys, he Raviſhments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take Man according to his proper Nature, and lie is a rare Creature, and ſo as a Quinteſſence extracted out of the Virtue of the whole Creation: He was made by Conſultation, the reſt of the Creatures God made by his Authority, there was but a <hi>Fiat, let there be made,</hi> and every thing received a Being: but Man was made by Deliberation, <hi>Faciamus Hominem, let us make Man,</hi> as if there were ſo many Secrets and things of Conſequence to be conſidered in Man, that the Wiſdom of the whole Deity was ſummoned to conclude upon them: he was made a Lord. The Son of <hi>Macrinus</hi> is ſaid to be born with a Crown on his Head: Sure I am Man at firſt was conſtituted a Prince. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ('tis ſaid) came out of his Mothers Womb with the ſhape of a Sword in his Hand; but Man carried the commanding Sword for all Creatures were made ſubject to him. Man was made to be the draught of Gods own Face, or the Creature wherein the Creator might ſeem (if it were poſſible) to be effigiated or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Let us make Man according to our Image and Similitude: <hi>Aug.

Magnes</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was ſo comely that he was carryed from City to City to be ſeen; the <hi>Magneſians</hi> were ſo taken with him, that the very ſight of him bereft them of their Judgment. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> a <hi>Bithinian,</hi> was ſo admired by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor for his rare Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that at his Death he built a Temple for him at <hi>Mantinea</hi> a City in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſtamp'd his Image upon his Coin. <hi>Demetrius Poliercetes</hi> was ſo ſurpaſſingly fair, that his Phyſiognomy could not be taken by any Painter. But what are all theſe to amiable <hi>Adam?</hi> when God had viewed every thing he had made, he only ſaid, <hi>It was good;</hi> but ſo ſoon as Man was Created, 'tis ſaid, God ſaw every thing he had made, and behold 'twas <hi>very Good,</hi> Gen. 1.31.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100984:30"/>Souls are your laſting Excellencies; it g ieveth me to ſee with what wonder ye look upon other things, and with what contempt upon your Citizens, with what care ye preſerve other things, with what diſdain ye over-look theſe in their Extremities; with what violence ye do puſh at theſe with Thigh and Shoulder, and beat them to pieces. Is there a more dying groan than for the neglect of theſe living Souls? Is there a ſhriller yell among you than the paſſionate Cry of the Oppreſſed? Let there be leſs Pride and Cruelty, and more Charity and Equity. The Bleſſings of a City, are the <hi>Perſons of a City, wherein are Perſons.</hi>

No, you go about to drown it, for there is a Ditch of Sins: oh, 'tis a dangerous thing to a City, when Sin doth walk up and down the Streets with a <hi>Sodoms</hi> Face, Guilt appearing in open Sight with an impudent Brow. 'Tis better to be defiled with Dirt than Sins. Oh, why do you ſcatter abroad your horrid Crimes? and fill every Corner with your Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are ye the Credit of the Corporation? No, when the City doth preſent you, it doth but ſhew her own Infamy and Diſgrace; your vitious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours, are worſe than if there were breaches in your Walls, your Buildings half Levelled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ye were Vertuous, the Innocency of your Lives would more adorn the City than the beautifying the Gates, for the City doth ſhine only in the preſence of Saints. Oh, therefore, leave no Stinks behind you, but perfume every place you ſet your Feet: your mortifyed Demeanours, and gracious Fruits do bring Fame and Renown to your City: what is your City-Sword, Seal, Hall, Bench? No, theſe are but dumb and dead Enſigns, the Honour of a City is in the Citizens, the Perſons, <hi>wherein are Perſons.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. Let this ſerve to fright Men from Blood-ſhed; Sacking a City is nothing like Slaughtering of the Perſons. If Men be of ſuch value, they ſhould not be hewen down like Brambles, nor butchered like Oxen: let ſhedding of Blood be in the moſt ſparing manner: Oh, thoſe curſed <hi>Cains, Doegs, Abimeleches, Hazaels</hi> and <hi>Herods,</hi> how deteſtable are they both to God and Man?

It is one of the <hi>Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> of Profeſſion, ſo to conſtitute War that there be no culpable ſcruple in the cloſe. Sure I am, there muſt be a full Authority, a juſt Cauſe, and a right Intention, ſo that it muſt not be <hi>ex odio</hi> out of hatred: and how is that but out of hatred, if a Man ſhould ſhed one drop more than what is neceſſary, out of Inſolency and Blood-thirſtineſs? the lives of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed are not wholy at the Mercy of the Conqueror, he had need di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh well between a Conqueror and a Cut-Throat A vindicative War is lawfuleſt; ſo that a Man muſt take heed he be not a too ſevere Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his own Injurys, he ought to be ſatiſfyed with the Victory, and, as much as may be leave Revenge to God. The Authors, and principal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors in an Injury ought to be Slain, but not the generality which are drawn in to be Parties: Killing is only allowed againſt obſtinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Adverſaries, for the Community cannot be touched without the hazard of many Innocents, ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> Conqueſt then muſt end with the leaſt dammage of Enemys and Inhabitants. <hi>Molina</hi> holdeth, a Chriſtian taking a Chriſtian Captive cannot ſell him to make him a Bond-Slave: Now if Liberty be ſo much tendred, how much more Life?

I confeſs, I have read, That the Son of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> ſpake at ſix Months, and ſaved his fathers life: and, That <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> the Son of <hi>Dugobert,</hi> the fortieth day after his Birth, being baptized by <hi>Amandus,</hi> plainly anſwered, <hi>Amen.</hi> And that Anno 1117. there was an Infant lying in the Cradle, made a long continued Speech to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſied in her Family Cares, wiſhing her not to be too intent upon worldly things, for God was ready to be reveng'd on the world inſtantly, if, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe things were done by miracle, and not by ordinary courſe of nature. <hi>Petrarch</hi> gives ſolid Comfort to a Parent bewailing the death of his Infant, wiſhing him not only not to be diſmayed, ſeeing his Child had eſcaped theſe afflictions, but chiefly to rejoyce, becauſe the ſtate of a dying Infant is <hi>without any Danger:</hi> for, ſaith he, <hi>An Infant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh ſhamefully, which doth depart without ſin.</hi> VVhat Sin can they have that have not Knowledg?

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100984:42"/>for is it not fit to provide much for them which by Nature do injoy ſo little? If thou wouldſt have them either Sages or Saints, prepare them a Brain ſtock, and a Conſcience-Livelihood, elſe thou maiſt leave them too much thy own, and let them ſhift in the world like unprovided Children with their ſimple Naturals: the breaſt is not more neceſſary than Inſtruction. Indeed the Parent ſhould be the grand Tutor to his Child: The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> would ſuffer their Children to learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of their own Parents. <hi>Agaſicles</hi> being demanded why he would not reſort to <hi>Philopanes</hi> to learn Philoſophy? No, ſaid he, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is able to inſtruct me in this, and 'tis moſt convenient for him to give Wiſdom, who gave Nature. Where Parents have been diligent herein, what eminent Children have they left behind them: <hi>Cambyſes</hi> teaching his Son <hi>Cyrus,</hi> how did he become afterwards the wonder of the World? <hi>Nicon,</hi> a Mechanick, but withall a very learned man, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Galen</hi> Arithmetick, Geometry, Aſtronomy, and other liberal Arts, how did he afterwards excel, and was eſteemed the Prince of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was ſo well inſtructed by a prudent She-parent, that he was Sir-named the <hi>Mother-taught:</hi> and he made ſuch a rare Diſciple of his Daughter <hi>Arete,</hi> that when he was dead, ſhe was able to keep up his School, and read Lectures. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was ſuch a School-maſter to his Daughter <hi>Dama,</hi> that ſhe excelled in all Learning. Such Ornaments may Children prove if Parents themſelves can beſtow good Education upon them. But if Parents cannot do this themſelves, let them not neglect at the deareſt rate to buy this abroad, 'tis the beſt purchaſe you can make for your Children: a Will cannot give ſuch Legacys. Oh bring thy pretious ſtones to theſe Lapidaries to be filed, and thy coſtly new-woven Cloths to theſe Dy-fats, to receive their Tincture. Remember <hi>Solomon</hi> hdeſired VViſdom more than Riches and Honour, its price is above the choiceſt Rubies: therefore, fill thy Son's Brains rather than his Purſe: provide thy Son VViſdom rather than a Mannor houſe, or multitude of Tenants: yea, go one ſtep further, Furniſh him with Grace, thou giveſt him none of this by Nature; no, <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things of God,</hi> Therefore, if thou haſt Grace thy ſelf, communicate it to thy Child: be ever imprinting in their minds Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precepts, and ingraving their Souls with celeſtial Characters. But if thou haſt not ſo much Judgment thy ſelf, think not only of the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Maſter, Dancing-School or Artillery-Ground, but ſettle thy Son under ſome Religious Divine, to purchaſe the Pearl, to have his Wits exerciſed in Scripture, to have the Eyes of his Underſtanding opened:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100984:42"/>that thy Child may be able to take the Latitude of Chriſtianity, yea, to comprehend the length, breadth; hight and depth of Chriſt Jeſus. What are all the Maxims of the Earth to the Myſteries of the Kingdom? no, Redemption, Juſtification, Adoption, Regeneration Faith, and to know a Right in the Tree of Life, excell all the Speculations that the double refin'd Wits of the times can teach otherwiſe. Oh then, that many men think their Children ſhould get theſe things only by ſitting under a Pulpit, or learning a publick Catechiſm, but not by making an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Schooling of the ſtudy of Virtue: No, people think that theſe things are to be taught at any rate, and in any time; they let them learn other things without theſe, or theſe with other things; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not their Children time nor means to make Grace a Trade: Seven years, is for a Calling, but I hear of no ſuch Apprentiſhip meerly to learn Religion: They have a ſtrange ſaving way in pious things: their own Conſciences coſts them little at the Pulpit, and they are as thrifty Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for the Souls of their Children in matters of Grace: the conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Divine hath few Diſciples of this nature; the Fencing, Dancing, and Muſick-Maſters, ſhall be preferred before him in Fees. Therefore, if you would have them ſerve God, train them up at the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence under them which may inſtitute and precept them in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true Godlineſs. Hiſtory abounds with examples of the good effects hereof. And, for hamane Learning I fine many liberal; <hi>Q. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> gave his Maſter <hi>Ennius</hi> a whole City: and <hi>Achilles</hi> gave his Maſter <hi>Phaenix,</hi> half his Kingdom and half his Honors: So among Chriſtians, I find for the learning Religion and Grace; <hi>Gracian</hi> gave unto <hi>Auſonius</hi> many preſents, and amongſt the reſt, a picture with his Fathers Image, ſet with pretious ſtones; telling him, He had paid but what he ought, and that he ought more than he had paid: and <hi>Matthias Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (that renouned Prince) beſtowed the whole Country of <hi>Veredarium</hi> upon his Maſter <hi>Joannes Viteſius:</hi> and infinite other Examples are to be produc'd on the ſame Account. Therefore if thou loveſt thy Childs Soul as well as his Body, provide ſome Maſter work-man to lay the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace and Holineſs.</p>

Yes, If our tame Beaſts forſook our Paſtures, and ran into the Woods; and the wild Beaſts forſook our Foreſts, and came running into our ſtrets, as they did in <hi>Germany</hi> in the year 1086. Or, That men were forced to draw in Trace, to plow the Lands, or to be yoked in Carts to carry up and down our Commodities; as it happened in thoſe diſmal Civil Wars under <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> the III.

The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Beaſt was ſo pretious to antient times, that they knew not how to give honour enough to them: <hi>Solon</hi> commanded all the People to ſacrifice to the Gods, for the uſe of the Ox, and made it as capital a Crime for any man to kill a Bullock, as to ſlay a Man: Oh, let us not viſit our Stalls without a Meditation, nor walk in our Paſtures without a Contemplation.</p>

Man was born naked, that out of a ſenſe of his Neceſſity he might have daily recourſe unto his God: he carrys his Beggars-wallet at his Back: Man would be a Proprietary, he is but a Stipendary. Hath God need of any Cattle? No, thou art the Cattle-Eater, and Cattle-uſer, he ſpared them for thee. Yea, 'Twas not enough that he ſpared <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> unleſs he ſpared <hi>the Cattle. And alſo cattle.</hi>

            <p>'TWas the earneſt Deſire of my Soul after the Proſperity of this famous and renouned City of LONDON, which ingag'd me to abridg and publiſh theſe prophetick Sermons: In the doing whereof, I am perſwaded, that none will (it having been my Care, all-along the Work that none ſhould) blame me for injuring the worthy Author: For, if any ſhould take the Pains to trace me through the whole, they will finde that I have omitted nothing eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, whereby the Work may be maimed; and (the Deſign conſidered viz. <hi>Brevity</hi>) that the ſubſtance of the Work may be had for a ſmall Price: Nor is there, in any one leaf of the Original, things of leſs Moment inſerted here, and thoſe of more weighty Concern omitted: This were a Fault I could not forgive my ſelf; nor could the Chiding of wiſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber perſons more diſcompoſe me, than my own Breaſt would be diſturb'd of it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons were preached in this City, about the Year 1655 or 1656; Their whole deſign was then to beget in the Hearers a hatred of SIN; and to preſs them to a ſpeedy REPENTANCE, by repreſenting the Wrath and Vengeance, Plagues and Judgments, which God pours down upon Mortals for their Offences: Therefore their Publication, now, cannot but be ſuppoſed ſeaſonably time'd: For, alas, alas! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years, there hath ſprung up (out of the Bottomleſs Pit, I had almoſt ſaid) a Generation of (what? ſhall I call them Devils? in the
<pb facs="tcp:100984:50"/>ſhape of) Men and Women, who, deſigning to Debauch this Age, have (by amazing Examples) ſucceeded too well in their Undertakings; for, by their Lying, Swearing, Curſing, Whoring, Cheating, Drinking, Perjury, Hypocriſy, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they out-brazen Heaven it ſelf, and bid Defiance to the God thereof, thereby ripening themſelves for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, except Repentance prevents. Well then, If Judgments were (as our Author ſaith) upon their March, Rank and File, ſo many years paſt; what man of Underſtanding is there that do's not ſee them drawn up, and preſenting, wanting only the Word from <hi>the God of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now then, Suppoſe, He begins with another Plague among Us; come. Oh ye Paterns (I had almoſt call'd ye Patrons too, of Wickedneſs,) you, with the reſt of them, both male and female, that have been poiſoned by your Examples, fall all to this work of Repentance: I ſay, where will YOU ſecure Your ſelves from the VVrath that is coming? VVill thoſe By-places of Secreſy, where You and your Miſſes, (to ſpeak modiſhly,) have Careſs'd together, ſecure you? No, no. You may Remember what ſhift you made to ſhun the laſt; Do ye think ye will not be met with now? VVhat, becauſe God in his Infinite VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was pleaſed not to make a Viſible; plain Diſtinction of his Love and Hatred to perſons, but the honeſt man dy'd of it as well as the diſhoneſt; thoſe that were faithful to the Marriage Bed are ſeiz'd by it, equal wth thoſe that have been falſe to that ſacred Tye: He that fears an Oath hath had God's Tokens, when he that flouds out Oaths hath been free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's no Reaſon for all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that 'tis the pleaſure of the Almighty: for, Should GOD in the Plague-time, or by any other diſtinguiſhing Judgment pick out, ſweep or hurry away the moſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Debauchees, He's and She's, 'twere enough to Scare SINS of all ſorts out of the World: This were, in effect, to anſwer <hi>Dives</hi>'s preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Petition, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.27.

                  </gap>'s</hi> ſpear, and ſo I might bring in Examples of all Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But God deals, not thus with poor Mortals: No, no, If the Threatnings of his VVord won't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from Sin; If his Promiſes wo'nt invite and allure us to a holy Life; his infinite Wiſdom directs to no other Means, but according as our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to his Word, ſo will it go with us to all Eternity: And yet (ſome times) God doth hang up ſad Examples of his Juſtice too. Oh! when Judgments ſtand ready, ſho'd not Mortals ſtand prepar'd for an Eternty? the Godly are by a holy Life, willing &amp; always ready, to ſubmit to the
<pb facs="tcp:100984:51"/>good Pleaſure of the Almighty; and to ſuch Judgment is no Judgment; and if it periods their natural Lives, it does, at the ſame Moment initiate an eternal one of Happineſs: But for the others; I mean thoſe that None can, with the largeſt degree of Charity imaginable, admit to belong to God, as ſuch, till true Repentance hath capacitated them: How ſhould theſe, together with the civiler ſort of Sinners, the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Lyers, unjuſt, the Rebellious, Diſobedient, the ſly Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall upon their Knees, and with Tears in their Eyes implore divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in time, before it be too late: For, ſhould Judgment ſeize theſe, be it of what kind it will, Wo's upon wo's will be their Portion; what Tongue can expreſs, what Heart can conceive (as the Joyes of the firſt, ſo) the Pain, Anguiſh and Torments of the other, which will be endleſs, eaſeleſs and remedileſs: If thoſe bodily Miſeries, (mentioned <hi>page</hi> 34,) will be ſo exquiſite as they may be managed by an Enemy, how dreadful and aſtoniſhing will it be, when theſe frightful and ſcaring ones ſhall be but as fiery Chariots to convey them to unquenchable Flames? as doubtleſs they will be to all wicked wretches, and ſuch who are contriving Plagues and Torments, and inventing Inſtruments of Cruelty for others, ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly feel their keeneſs themſelves, together with all thoſe that approve of, conſent to, or connive at the ſame, without true and ſpeedy Reforming. Trifle not away time, tho' tis true, Late Repentance may ſave, yet 'tis ſo great a hazard, that 'tis next to, tho not an Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and, if of the right ſtamp, yet there's theſe Uncomfortable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in a dying or a laſt gaſp Repentance. 1. In this life, God can have no Glory by it; which, if Heaven could admit of any Sorrow, 'twould be this, that they repented no ſooner; that they brought God Glory no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there ſhould be ſo much inward Joy and Peace in a holy Life; and that they ſhould by Impenitency deprive themſelves thereof. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves nor their Relations can have any Comfort in it; becauſe words on a Death-bed can expreſs no more than what others have ſaid; and thoſe, when recovered, their Sins have receiv'd life too: Now an evangelical holy Life is the infallible Teſtimony of a ſound ſincere Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: And my Soul for thine, if thou liveſt this Evangelical Life, and doſt not joyn it with, nor place it in the room of Chriſt, expecting Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, thou wilt certainly be eternally ſaved.</p>
            <p>Flatter not your ſelves with fooliſh Hopes or Perſwaſions, That thoſe which do'nt Swear, Curſe, Blaſpheme, Whore, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are a parcel of
<pb facs="tcp:100984:51"/>damn'd Hypocrites; and as bad as the worſt, only they don't ſhew it, and appear ſo to the world, but <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well then, by thy own Confeſſion, ſo far as one do's keep ſtom theſe Extuberances of Wickedneſs, they are better than them that run to the exceſs thereof, only thy Conceit is that they are Diſſemblers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, to pleaſe thee, we'll grant it, tho', 'tis the worſt thou canſt judg, and the worſt certainly will be their own: But, I prethee, what do's he loſe by abſtaining from theſe Exceſſes of SIN, tho', as I ſaid, he be a Hypocrite, and therefore miſerable, yet his Torments, if compared with thine, will be the leſs; and all thy gains by thy aboundings therein, plagues in this life, and the hotteſt flames in the next. Again, Will their Hypocriſy excuſe thy abominable Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſuch as a very Heathen would abhor thee for? No, Know, that Hypocriſy will as certainly convey them to Hell as thy open Prophaneſs will hurry thee thither, without Repentance in both; the one Inns there at a Snails pace; the other Poſts thither: The one enters as at the Back-door, the other bounces open the great Gates. And, as for theſe two ugly Sins of Swearing and Curſing; 'Tis too probable, nor can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd beyond bounds of Charity, but that Curſing Perſons are Curſed Perſons, <hi>ſtatu quo;</hi> and, Swearing Perſons are. Too oft, forſworn Perſons; for, if the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.19. <hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not Sin;</hi> certainly in the multitude of Oaths, there wanteth not Sin, and that to a very high degree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Great Out-Cry againſt: Hypocrites is, their good Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet their contrary Practices when 'tis in their Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Good pretended; they declaim againſt Swearing &amp; Curſing, and yet are helliſh Lyers; rail againſt Whoremongers and Adulterers, and yet are devilliſh brisk ſlyly with their Neighbours Wife or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is very ſad indeed, and deſerves to be lamented in Tears of Blood, if poſſible: This is a Wound that goes to the Heart of a true Child of God, that the holy Name of God ſhould be thus reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and blaſphem'd; as if the Goſpel had loſt its Regenerating and Sanctifying Virtue! and did nothing, now, upon the Souls of Men and Women, but make a parcel of Hypocrites, Factious perſons, Rebels and Traytors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, Grant thy Accuſations to be truth, and there can be no pleading for them. Yet, this I'le ſay in Vindication of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Goſpel; That, now, there are true Converts; them that are born again, for, the Blind ſee, the Deaf hear, the Dumb ſpeak, the Lame walk,
<pb facs="tcp:100984:52"/>and the Poor receive the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as for theſe Evil doers, and only Pretenders to Good, We diſown them, for they are but the better ſort of your ſelves, crept or ſneak'd among the truly Godly, becauſe they are more inlightned then the greateſt DON's of ye all that wallow like ſwine in your carnal beaſtly Pleaſures: Beſides, the Hypocrite's going into Secret to commit his Sin, thereby condemns himſelf, and thee too, by being ſo impudent to make it ſo notoriouſly viſible: therefore ye wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Wretches! Oh that I might (now) prevail with you, either to make known your Priviledge and Authority, whereby ye have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered a Kingdom by provoking the Almighty to ſhowr down Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or, if ye be aſhamed to vindicate it by Arguing for it: Can ye do your Souls a greater Kindneſs, nay, can ye bring greater glory to God than by (ſetting up in the Kingdom a Patern of) Repentance?</p>
            <p>And, as for your ſpeaking of good Pretences and no performances. This is an Evil which can have no Advocate: Therefore 'tis neceſſary to conſider the Good pretended to, whether it be an eſſential, neceſſary and univerſal Good; and if God's time be come, he will find out fit Inſtruments, that ſhall not only Pretend, but intend and actually do it. Indeed, I wonder that men ſeeming to have pregnancy of Wit at a more than ordinary rate; in other things, ſhould yet herein be ſhort; That they do openly blame Good Deſigns, becauſe thoſe Deſigns have met with bad Managers; when as, at the ſame time, they ſecretly commend the pretended Deſign: Now, I conceive, that if the Deſign be good and honorable it ought to be followed, till it meet with real Intenders which at firſt muſt be Pretenders: Or, why do'nt you, that are the Fault-finders, undertake it your ſelves? But as for Hypocrites in general, this may be ſaid of them, That they are the white Devils, and they have more wit than to aſſociate with the Impudent ſhameleſs Sinner of any ſort; tho' the worſt of them too may act the Hypocrite, in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing, yet not ſo as wholy to deſerve the name of Hypocrite: You muſt look for the Hypocrite among the beſt, and not among the worſt of men.</p>
            <p>Now, for Hypocrites, or any other, I may with very much certainty affirm, 'tis not difficult to know from whence any get their Riches or Honours; or any thing elſe that looks like a Bleſſing; whether from God or elſe where, whether with a Bleſſing or a Curſe? &amp;c. For, if Riches flow in, or thou art advanced to honours; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thou art proud, envious; oppreſſive; turn'ſt a Drunkard, Swearer, Curſer, Whoremonger; an Evill
<pb facs="tcp:100984:52"/>Example among thy Neighbours, a Sabbath breaker, a Hater of God, and his People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> certainly, as long as thou continueſt ſuch, thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God in kindneſs; but in the midſt of thy Injoyments, 'tis with thee as with them in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.31. <hi>while their Meat was in their Mouths, the Wrath of God came upon them;</hi> curſt in all thy Concerns, tho ſeemingly thou proſpereſt. 'Tis the like for Adverſity, you may know whether God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth thee to a meaner Condition, in Mercy, or in his Diſpleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> by thy Behaviour to God in that Condition; when God bringeth low one of his own, for Tryal ſake, or for other Ends beſt known to himſelf; oh with what Submiſſiveneſs, Humility, Love to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Patience, Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth he behave himſelf towards God! But another man, how impatient is he? he frets and fumes, rages and ſtorms, ſwears and curſes, omits all Duty to God; blaming this and t'other Inſtrument; and is like a wild Bull in the net, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, without all Doubt, thou wilt own Debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as Advancement to be in Kindneſs to thy Soul, if thou once becomeſt a right <hi>Ninevite,</hi> i.e. a true Penitent.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear the Debauchees of this Age deride this innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Grace of Repentance, and with their black. Mouths ridiculing it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What need of it now more than formerly? and wickedly conclude by fulfilling that Prophecy in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>all things continue as they were from the Beginning of the Creation;</hi> tho' they will be miſerably miſtaken, as they may, even in this Generation, to their eternal confuſion find. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heartily wiſh, that I could perſwade men from living at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as though it were a piece of Policy and Diſcretion to live at uncertainties, in Doubts and Fears, either, as if there were no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or, as tho' there were no right Directions how to obtain it, therefore no ſuch great need of this Duty of Repentance, as is pretended, to make them capable of it.</p>
            <p>The Truth is; Moſt men live (the more's the pity 'tis ſo where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is profeſt) as if 'twere hazardous, or, at leaſt, comfortleſs to be too zealous for the very Truths of the Goſpel themſelves; and therefore they enervate the Power of every Commandment both Legal and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; and, to quiet their Conſciences, patch up Rules to themſelves far ſhort of the Power of Godlineſs; thinking it impoſſible that any can live, in truth, to a higher degree of Holineſs than themſelves: and by thoſe home-ſpun Rules guide their Lives, and ſo miſcarry to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That Threatning of our Saviour's in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That except your Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye
<pb facs="tcp:100984:53"/>ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> may be, by the Bleſſing of God, a Sin-confounding, and a Soul-preſerving Word, if 'twere every day ſounded in the ears of the Debauches of this Age: Nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what kind of Conſtruction, Interpretation or Expoſition their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers make thereof, or they underſtand thereby: What are they ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that Debauchery and Hypocriſy divide the whole world? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurely they do, elſe holier Lives would be the Conſequent of better Thoughts: They think thus, or more wickedly, That at the laſt day, all being alike, God Almighty will, not reſpecting how men have lived in this World, pick out ſome to eternal Salvation, and poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (becauſe they are in a ſinful ſenſe Self-lovers) they hope they may be the Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Looking upon Faith and Repentance which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel directs to, as improbable, yea impoſſible; tho' indeed, in the true Believer, they produce a holy Life, which juſtifies them to be neither dead nor ſpurious: and yet in point of Juſtification, he renounces his Righteouſneſs, and counts it as a menſtruous cloth, as to any ſtead it can ſtand him in, to the ſatisfying Divine Juſtice, and wholy relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Merits of JESUS CHRIST; which for any other but a Child of God to do is impoſſible. No, others will look a-ſquint at their own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' in words they may own Chriſt; but 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to go out of themſelves, and rely upon and another for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Wherefore the whole life of a Chriſtian in this Word is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to others, and underſtood by none but ſuch as are inſtructed by the Spirit of God: And, as there's a Myſtery in Godlineſs, ſo there's a Myſtery of Iniquity; a Child of God admires how Strangers and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can have any reſt and quiet in their own Boſoms how they can eat, drink, ſleep, or indeed do any thing till they have made their peace with God; and got the pardon of their Sins in the Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; leſt in the interim, becauſe they carry their breath in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils as well as others, they ſhould lye down in everlaſting Flames, where the Worm dyes not, and the ſire goes not out: which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly muſt be to ſuch, who live and dye ſtrangers to the Power of Faith and REPENTANCE.</p>
